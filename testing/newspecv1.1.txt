Here is the initial state of each Testing processes

Process Name	PID*	Priority
TEST1		1	LOW
TEST2		2	LOW
TEST3		3	LOW
TEST4		4	LOW
TEST5		5	LOWEST
TEST6		6	LOW

*The PIDs will be changed to 1~6 in the code delivered to students

TEST1 sends  to TEST2 the following testing request messages identified by REQ# below:
  #100 M_TEST_IPC_REQ1
  #101 M_TEST_PRIORITY_REQ1
  #102 M_TEST_MEM_REQ1

  Test1 waits for TEST2 to report all the testing result messages identified 
  by RST# below  

  #120 M_TEST_IPC_RST1
  #121 M_TEST_PRIORITY_RST1
  #122 M_TEST_MEM_RST1

TEST2 receives the three testing requests.

  M_TEST_IPC_REQ1 gets relayed to TEST3
  M_TEST_PRIORITY changes the priority of TEST5 to LOW so that TEST5 can send 
  message
  M_TEST_MEM_REQ1 gets relayed to TEST6
  
  TEST2 then waits for TEST3, TEST5 and TEST6 to send the testing results back

TEST3 does IPC testing
  It sends a positive testing result back to TEST2 if upon receiving
  the M_TEST_IPC_REQ1 message

TEST4 does release_process infinitely at priority level of LOW

TEST5 does priority setting testing
  It sends the priority testing result back to TEST2 

TEST6 does memory testing
  It allocates two memory blocks and check whether they are the same or not.
  If they are not, test passes, otherwise, test fails. The test result gets
  sent back to TEST2


Whenever a message is sent, janusROM terminal will output text indicating which
message # has been sent from which process to which process. Similar text
will show when a message is received by a process. Here is an example of
output from the dBUG terminal:

------------------------------------------------------
RTXEVAL: Test1 sending REQ #100
RTXEVAL: Test2 received message #100 from PID 1
RTXEVAL: Test2 sent message #100 to PID 253
RTXEVAL: Test3 received message #100 from PID 2
RTXEVAL: Test3 sent message #120 to PID 254
RTXEVAL: Test2 received message #120 from PID 3
RTXEVAL: Test1 Received result # 120 from PID 2, PASS
RTXEVAL: Test1 sending REQ #101
RTXEVAL: Test2 received message #101 from PID 1
RTXEVAL: Test2 setting Test5 priority from 1 to LOW...
RTXEVAL: Test5's new priority is: 1
RTXEVAL: Test5 sent message #121 to PID 2
RTXEVAL: Test5 resetting its priority to LOWEST
RTXEVAL: Test2 received message #121 from PID 5
RTXEVAL: Test1 Received result # 121 from PID 2, FAIL
RTXEVAL: Test1 sending REQ #102
RTXEVAL: Test2 received message #102 from PID 1
RTXEVAL: Test2 sent message #102 to PID 6
RTXEVAL: Test6 received message #102 from PID 2
RTXEVAL: Test6 sent message #122 to PID 2
RTXEVAL: Test2 received message #122 from PID 6 
RTXEVAL: Test1 Received result # 122 from PID 2, PASS
RTXEVAL: Final Evaluation Result is 0x5
--------------------------------------------------------

How to read testing results:

/* Testing Results are in the first 16 bit of the message */
/* testing pass -> bit set to 1
   testing fails-> bit set to 0

   bit 3~15 will be filled with a certain pattern
   to indicate this is a testing result message

   The following diagram is the initial state of each
   testing result bit

 15 14 13 12 11 10 09  08   07  06  05  04  03  02  01 00
